"333","other","34","bachelor","You need to have a few more obvious attention checks and not threaten to reject people if they don't mark every other one as being the same. Some still had small differences, even though you wanted them to be marked the same. The longer I did this, the more I felt like I should not have bothered & that you're just looking for an excuse to reject and not pay for my time. Hoping I'm wrong.","2020-03-26 20:50:50","2020-03-26 21:12:35"
