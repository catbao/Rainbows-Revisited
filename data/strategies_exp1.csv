"subjectid","strategy"
"37","I just examined and tried to rule out the least common. If I couldn't figure it out, I found by crossing my eyes and/or looking at the image from the corner of my eye helped. "
"40","When there were a different number of bodies forming. Like an extra cloud on the side."
"39","I wanted to see how far apart each part was and how many parts."
"43","I was looking for parts that were extra or sticking out."
"41","I looked for differing color patterns, gaps, and shapes."
"42","I would look at it and then look away and then come back to view for final time."
"38","I looked to see if there were any ""cleaving"" or scattering, making the dots less concentrated"
"35","I just looked for any difference in the outlining shape of them.  I admit, though, it was actually kind of difficult and I found myself just having to guess many times."
"47","Some were more obvious, some were very difficult, but I really tried to find the subtle differences. One strategy I also tried was to first focus on 3 that looked most similar, an indirect way to finding the outlier. Thank you. "
"49","Positioning helped the most.  Sometimes there were obvious features such as shapes being different as well.  Other than that, I had to intently focus and look for other cues such as density and color."
"50","I just looked at them holistically"
"54",
"56",
"55","The diffuse bits or the colored bits."
"57","Difference in patterns, concentration of colors, position of masses."
"58","just the one that looked the most different to me is the one I picked"
"64","Shape and color"
"67","ones that were more fuzzy and dispersed were different."
"66","I tried to compare the shapes of the brighter lit areas and whether not if they were in the same area as the other pictures or if something was off about them."
"65","I was looking for the shape and color."
"69","I looked at the negative space and the general shapes."
"70","I focused on the changes in the image. "
"72","Mostly colors and pattern shapes and matching them to other pics."
"73","i looked at the different shades of color. i looked to see if 3 of the pictures had 3 similar patterns or shadings. i also looked to see how deep the color was comapred to the others"
"80","I tried to see how crowded spaces were in each image. Tried to outline the shape in my mind for each image and compared them."
"76","based on the pics that had the least identical shapes and sometimes colors."
"85","I tried to match up the three that looked closest to one another to find the oddball"
"82","I tried to line up the most obvious parts because often on of them was out of line with the others and then I knew it was the picture that was different"
"89","I looked to see if shapes were different, if they were turned a little differently, or placed a little higher or lower."
"93","I was looking for patches of color"
"96","I looked for gaps that were different or compared 2 squares, if they were the same, eliminated them and then looked the next 2 to work my way down to the one odd one."
"83","I tried to find the pictures with the most similar bright spots in the color and decipher which one was different based off that. "
"87","I first looked at the images to see it there is a drastic change between the 4 images. I will narrow it down to 2 images and then I look for the one image that looks the most different from the way some of the characteristics are shaped or how dark/bright some of the characteristics in the images are."
"94","look at the  color and then the shape of each and compare"
"90","tried to look at all of them at the same time and then guess which one was different after guessing which three were the most similar"
"104","I tried to look at genereal shape, size, color depth."
"101","see the position first and then the shape"
"99","angles of large shapes, number of large shapes, distance from edges sometimes. location. distance between shapes"
"103","the sourinding faint image"
"95","The one that I couldn't match with the other's because of added shading or different shape."
"105","I didn't really have a strategy! I just went with my intuition regarding the overall shape and color distribution of the images."
"102","I looked for the size and shapes when deciding"
"111","I looked for similarities in two of the pictures and then found a third that matches those two"
"98","i looked to see if the cluster of color was similar to the rest. if there was a slight deviation to the color or the shape, i thought it was the right option"
"112","Just looking for any difference at all"
"107","I tried to find the general shapes and the distance they were from the edge of the image. Sometimes I could decipher different shapes in one image compared to the others."
"114","I was looking for the picture that had an obvious inconsistency."
"121","patterns of darkness"
"124",
"119","i looked at the shape and color and compared them"
"125","Looked at what images had the most noticeable different colors. Looked directly between all 4 pictures and let peripheral vision spot the differences."
"123","Used the edges to see if they matched."
"120","I looked for changes in shape, brightness, and overall placement. "
"116","I was looking at proportion and size "
"129","Some stuck out very obviously. Others, however, I checked their placement, shadow, and reflection to determine which didn't belong. "
"130","I concentrated on the shape of the outline of the heatmap as well as seeing which regions seemed to be joined and separated between the options. At times it was very obvious and other times it was very difficult to point out the odd choice out."
"134","I was looking at the shape of the mass as a whole, the direction it appeared to be going, and the color chart to see if there was darker colors present. "
"132","I just tried to focus on the over all shape and colors in the images."
"136","I would stare at the images in almost a haze and which one stood out as not belonging was what I chose. "
"138","I looked at the shapes and the brightness in the shades of the color of the images. Some of them were quite difficult to see."
"140","I tried to compare shapes and color."
"139","I looked at the main shapes of the colors and looked for patterns in the clusters of colors."
"145","I tried to look for spots where pieces were separated, I also tried to unfocus my eyes sometimes to see if I could spot a difference that way. If anything was brighter on one spot that the  others didn't have."
"142","I just looked for slight differences in positioning and coloration."
"143","I looked at the shapes to see which matched, as well as the concentration levels of certain colors in certain areas. This allowed me to determine which areas of the image should be coming up what colors, on top of what the general shape should be. Also, this took close to a half hour to do, and 3 dollars is a bit low for the work and time that this took to do. "
"147","symmetry of shapes, intensity of colors, patterns of colors, contrast between fore and background"
"148",
"146","I was looking at shades of light/color, whether they were darker or lighter based on clusters and how much, if any space there was within/around those clusters from one image to the next. Sometimes it was fairly obvious, other times it definitely required a lot of squinting and process of elimination. "
"150","I was looking for different shapes or different color patterns when deciding. "
"153","just looking for slide fading or inconsistencies "
"154","I tried to pay attention to colors and the shapes the colors made. Some you could see one had a different shape compared to the rest. Others I had to go by the lack of color in one compared to rest, or more color in one compared to rest."
"155","I paid attention to the difference in shapes. How close shapes were together. I compared blank parts of the image with filled parts. I compared with edge of photo, placement of shape in picture. At times I tried to let it just 'pop out' and reveal itself to me on its own(at glance)"
"156","I would first try to compare the over-all shape of each image then compare the individual blobs in each picture"
"160","stay back from the monitor and see the shapes farther away helped maybe. mostly look for the density of the colors on the edges."
"161","I just tried to look at the outlines and position of each pattern and picked the image that looked differently compared to the other three patterns."
"159","I looked for differences in shape, spaces between light, dark areas, variations of brightness and varies of spray."
"162","concentration of color, where angles lie, similar ratio of concentration in an area to another area"
"163","I tried to find a pattern and then decide which image deviated from it in some way. I usually checked the overall shapes first. I didn't really consider the more subtle aspects unless I was having difficulty deciding."
"165","i used my instinct."
"166","The overall shape and the colors inside it"
"170","I went with what felt right"
"180","I was looking at the shapes the colors were making to try to figure out what didn't belong."
"177","I was just trying to focus on shading and matching them up based on subtle details."
"167","The one that stood out the most but there were groups that looked all equally"
"168","I move future from my laptop screen so I can see everything in perspective.  Then I started to look for which ones that look similar and then look for the odd man out. Often, Just by moving further away from the screen, I can instantly see which one is not right.  "
"188","I was looking for differences in the boxes."
"207","I looked for what was missing.  "
"171","Tried to see the general shapes and imagine how they'd be effected if contrast is changed"
"185","changes in the dispersion of white"
"208","Which one had a pattern that stood out"
"187","i was looking for the position and size of each of the objects in the tile. i was comparing it in relation to the others. i would first try to find the 2 most similar ones. then i would try to match a 3rd one to the 2 similar ones. then the 4th would be the odd one out. "
"213","How the shape compared to the 3 others and any configurations, also looked for for when shapes broke off from it's original part."
"176","Just looking closely"
"193","I looked for shaped or patterns, especially lines or connections between different groupings. If that didn't get a clear answer I looked at the density of features. "
"178","nothing special"
"190","well there were some that were easy to tell apart, others were trickier. i tried to just look at the overall shapes and see if some were slightly different or if the colors were changed in one"
"201","I was just trying to judge, 1) how many main spots there were or 2) if the images has more space filled up between them."
"192","shapes and shades were important in the decision"
"175","I was trying to notice slight changes the way the colors were applied. Like parts of the images that were just slightly moved or stretched"
"196","There were many visual features and I basically just had to look closely and decide which one was the odd one out."
"217","I looked at both the brightness and overall shape of the 'clouds.' I also looked (a bit) at where the shapes were in the square."
"205","I tried to look for the differences in shape first and then in color or color intensity to pick the most different one."
"218","I just tried to notice difference in positions and filled space"
"220","The most obvious is when the blobs were split different, but also different shapes and different concentrations of color. "
"186","I was looking at colors and shapes"
"215","I would look if one is not connected to the other object or if the sizes are different, or if the pattern is shown differently. "
"181","Nothing, only careful looking."
"216","the lighter spots positions"
"219","I just looked at the way the colors curved. "
"227",
"212","I was just trying to see if any of them were different and if any stood out as different. "
"224","I just looked for particular shapes and such in each image and used that to narrows them down. I also started at certain points and worked in a circle."
"204","Some of the images had dots or specific pattern formation, so when I decided ,I looked for three that had those in common the most and then choose the one that didn't "
"241","shape"
"240",
"228","I looked at the shapes and the separations in the areas. sometimes the positions of distinctive parts"
"182","I look for differences in shapes first. Those are the easy ones. For the harder ones, I look for differences in density and placement."
"230","I mostly just looked for big shapes in color. Nothing more complex than that."
"239","I looked at each image individually to see if they had differing shapes or sizes. I also looked at color and position."
"229","Mostly I looked at position.  If the colors were evident I sometimes went by whether a certain color was more prominent ()red, mainly)."
"234",
"214","I was looking for missing colors, unsimilar shapes, and just different patterns in general."
"223","I think the first one was generally an overall shape, some kind of discernible pattern that may be different in one of the images or in a slightly different arrangement.  

After that I would normally look to what I would refer to as ""density"", sometimes different areas of the image would seem more or less densely shaded and it seemed to make a difference.

Beyond that I think it was mostly color, how weak or strong the coloration of different parts of the image were.  In the event that I really couldn't tell much difference between them, I would normally fall back entirely to this one and try my best to guess which had the most ""off"" balance of color relative to the others."
"243","if the shapes were the same and if the amount of redness showing heat was the same"
"226","based on the colors"
"210","I quickly looked at all images to see if I could spot the one that did not belong.  If I couldn't, I looked at the images in more detail, such as patterns, did it fill the whole square, or was there something different about any of them."
"237","I looked at the overall positioning of the images relative to each other. If they made sort of distinct shapes then I would compare those. Sometimes I backed away from the monitor a little in case distance helped (it kind of didn't)"
"248","I just tried to look for whichever image didn't fit the pattern."
"238","i looked at the gradient of the dots surrounding the main structure as well as high intensity features. also the general shape of the objects"
"250","I looked at overall shape and color consistency. "
"251","I was looking for the area that seemed subtly different than the other three areas. This usually worked well for me."
"254","I looked for the color scale in the harder ones and the other ones if the shape was not like the others it was different."
"255","I looked for breaks in the patterns shared in the other three images, predominately. Often none of them were identical, but usually the three most similar ones had a similar pattern and shape to them, and thus a similar color scattering. I looked for this and just picked the one that seemed the least similar. Sometimes I couldn't see any differences and just had to guess. This wasn't an easy task, but I tried. I hope I didn't get too many wrong, because I did put effort into this and it would be really awful to get rejected despite working hard to get the right answers."
"249",
"253","I looked for how similar the colors were. I also looked at the shapes to determine which ones were different."
"256","I see in small different some images"
"260","which one is different images"
"244","No strategy. I just went with was visually different"
"252","I tried to match the outline of shapes."
"264","I looked at the overall shape of the features, the angles between features, how ""cloudy"" the areas between structures were and where structures were in relation to each other. I would sometimes go by the color density (i.e., more or fewer red dots in the center of something), but generally only if the other tests weren't conclusive."
"263","I was looking at the patterns of the dots and comparing them one by one to see which one was off."
"267","none"
"262","I was looking at the patterns and distribution of colors when deciding."
"265","Used the shapes to determine the different ones"
"266","I looked at the shape, then the colors, then distribution amount of  the colors.  "
"270","Brightness, spacing, groups"
"268",
"272","I do not feel that I used a ""strategy"" other than simply observing all the images and based on their appearance, simply selecting the one that does not look as much like the others. I considered all visual features that I perceived."
"276","i looked at the general shape of the blotches, and then I looked at the color distribution."
"273","First I looked for larger-scale differences in the shape of the color pattern, like a darker channel through a lighter area that was only present in one or three of the images. If I couldn't see differences like that, I looked at how close the features appeared to be to the edges of the image."
"274","I looked at the shapes and sizes of the colors. Eventually I figured out that I should look at the location of the colors in relation to the square as well."
"277","I looked at the colors and the shapes."
"275","i look for missing bits or how connected parts where or if brighter parts seemed dimmer"
"278","I tried to notice any obvious or subtle differences that made one image stand apart from the others, such as variations in shapes or colors."
"280","the one most different than the others , it was quite challenging though"
"281","My procedure was I took an overall look to see if anything stuck out as being different. The next step was I compared two of the photos to each other until I found two that were really close or almost exact, then I compared the other two to see which of those matched the least. Sometimes it was rather difficult."
"282","I would try to focus on things such as size or positioning. For example, sometimes all the ""objects"" would be focused on a particular corner, but one was more centered. Or, one of the ""objects"" would be larger or more distorted than the others. That is primarily how I made my decisions."
"283","I just tried to look for whichever one ""stood out"" to me instinctually."
"389","I would sometimes sit back to see if I could get a better perspective. I focused quite a bit more on the grayish dots and their location than the colored parts. I do feel I did best with the first section that was orange/red."
"390","Either completely different shapes, or markedly different intensity in some spots"
"391","Shapes, spaces between the shapes, position on the page."
"392","i looked for different shapes and different designs in the image."
"393","How close to the edges each ones where and looking at the obvious traits."
"398","I tried to look at shape, color, placement, everything."
"402","I tried to look for direction, size, intensity and extra shapes"
"397","Just observing the differences. "
"396","if you focus on the images you can see the distictions better"
"399","I looked for the patter that every image follows. Based on that I decided."
"405","I looked for distance between shapes and then concentration of colors."
"401","I tried hard to match shapes and colors, intensity of colors, minute differences as best as I could determine."
"406","How different the figures and the colors are from the other shapes."
"407","Nothing in particular. Just looked for the one that was the most different."
"408","The one that was different"
"411","I looked for the general shapes and their position within the image first, when those were all very similar I would judge by the colors and their intensity."
"412","There was no strategy, I just tried to find the wrong one. Every picture in every set was different, there was no particular visual feature to look for"
"413","I was looking for all kind of different visual features in order to decide whether a picture belongs or not. Things like: shape, color, saturation and size of it as well."
"415","Density, colors, spacing, shape conformity, depth
I tried to ""relax"" my vision, and feel which one was ""off"""
"416","The image that was most different from the rest"
"418","First I checked the placement of the main masses and excluded any one that was clearly out of place. Next I looked at the color intensity to see if one was too hot or too cool.If I still hadn't found the odd one, I checked the faint background masses for an anomaly. A few I thought seemed like two matched pairs, that formed two paired sets."
"420","I paid very close attention to the shapes and shading of each of the four images. Some of the images were more difficult than others as they looked very similar to each other. "
