"subjectid","strategy"
"291","I tried to use the general shape of the object, and color intensity."
"293","I didn't really have any set strategy. I just took my time to try and study the images and trying to find one that looked different from the rest. "
"295","I checked all images presented to see if 3 were alike while 1 was different. If I felt all 4 were too similar to single one out, I'd label them not discernible"
"296","I was mostly looking for size differences or if tails on certain formations looked slightly off from the other 3."
"297","I was looking at the shape of the more distinctly colored parts of the image as well as the spread of the outer dots around those shapes."
"294","I looked for abnormalities in the outline of the pictures to view differences."
"300","How dark colors were and where the borders were. Also, overall shapes of objects."
"302","I was looking for the same shapes. "
"303","Mostly at the shapes, then the positioning within the window"
"307","Different sizes of the shapes and different shapes in general. "
"306","If the blobs in one image were at different angles from each other compared to the other three."
"308","Differences in pattern and density."
"309","I looked at shapes and the negative space around the colors."
"310","i looked closely"
"317","I was focusing on the overall shapes in the images and looking for minor or major differences in one of them."
"318","shapes and color intensity"
"312","I tried to compare all the images and then came to a decision. I asked myself do they look similar? Or is there an odd one out?"
"313","I looked at the pattern where areas were dense and compared and also the size and position of the image."
"325","Where the images were places and any small placement differences."
"323","i looked at the image as a whole and not the individual dots"
"322","I looked at the heat map and I tried to look at the images that were the most similar. When I saw there was barely a difference I clicked that there was no difference."
"329","if they did not match or had an outlier"
"315","I was looking for colors first of all then shape and patterns."
"328","This was tough! I really looked at certain shapes and angles of the images. The color would change in these areas so I paid more attention to that as well."
"321","I tried to look at overall shape of the patterns."
"332","Difference in pattern and color"
"326","How difference or far - part of a image is.... "
"333","I mean, I was thinking that every other one needed to be marked as no difference, since you're threatening to reject over it. :/
Other than that, I was trying my best to decide when you wanted a small difference to count or not. You also need to pay more for this and have better attention checks because I would not want to work for you again."
"311","That was fairly difficult, and I am sure that I got some wrong.  The strategy I used was look first.  If I couldn't find anything, I would squint.  I also would turn my head both directions and look at it and squint also."
"334","I tried looking at shapes when trying to sort out the items. "
"340","I tried to find the odd one out as best as I could but many were so similar it was very tough to tell"
"335","different shape or angle "
"339","I compared how close some objects were to the edge of the square. I compared density and colors. I looked for any sort of deviation from the others. It was really hard though."
"337","I saw the color of image and find the different shape of the image."
"341","I tried to mentally superimpose the images on each other and decided that way. Kind of like how those old ""find the difference"" games between two pictures went."
"342","I looked for differences in the borders and if there were differences in size or color."
"345","I was mostly looking for the shape of the images."
"344","I was looking at my first impression.  Also color patterns and what looked different.  Kind of hard to do in lots of cases."
"346","distance from the sides, thickness, color levels"
"351","I was just hoping for a major difference in location or shape. If those weren't there, I could not notice a difference in the images."
"350","I looked them all over generally and if I got a sense/feeling one was different, I tried comparing it to the other three."
"353","I checked the positioning, patterns and the object with more colours or less."
"354","i just looked at the shape overall and tried to see if i noticed anything that looked different "
"355","This was really hard. I was looking for any significant shift in the image, gaps where there was more darkness in one, chunks that were obviously brighter. When they all looked the same, I went and tried to compare each one to the 2 next to it to look for differences."
"357","how big the light areas were"
"359","The general shape and location of the things on the image."
"360","I was looking out for variations in image sets"
"362","any main difference"
"363","I was focused on shapes and sizes"
"365","is good"
"367","patterns, connection, density, direction"
"370","I tried to look at them all at the same time to look at and differences. Then I looked at each individually. "
"369","shapes and shading"
"375","Primarily, I was looking for where the density of the brighter colors deviated in terms of location.  Some of the images had regions which were a little more diffuse, but when deciding what was different I concentrated more of the location, rather than density or brightness."
"378","During the trials, I paid attention to how the colors changed from image to image, and then the borders of the shapes. However, I found that I needed more information than that to choose the right answer, so I soon started focusing on the overall shape, as well. I looked at the patterns in the images. For the dark images, I blinked to refocus my eyes on the overall shape, since it was a bit hard to see, and would take a look again at it."
"379","I just compared each picture and looked for differences."
"383","The Arrangement"
"385","the outline. my mind was making the outline of the images in the boxes into various living things in my head so I could discern. no idea if it paid off or not &#9786;"
"387","The shapes of the figures to see if they matched. "
